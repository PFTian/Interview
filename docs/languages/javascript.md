8. In a program, how can you delete the variables? Is there any limit on deletion?

   This task can be done simply with the help of an operator and i.e. Delete. Although it deletes all the variables, as well as the objects in a program itâ€™s is not possible for this operator to delete those objects and variables that are declared already with the VAR keyword. For deleting these variables, another command is to be followed. Any number of other variables can be deleted with this operator. It is also possible to erase a specific portion of coding simply and without accessing any other command for this.
